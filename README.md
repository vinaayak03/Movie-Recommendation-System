Movie Recommendation System and Web Application using Python

This project features a movie recommendation system along with a web application built using Python. The primary goal is to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history.

The recommendation system employs two key techniques: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior and preferences, suggesting movies that similar users have enjoyed. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, utilizes the attributes of movies, such as genre, director, and cast, to recommend films similar to those a user has previously liked.

The web application serves as the user interface, allowing individuals to input their preferences, browse movie recommendations, and access details about suggested films. The application is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, enhancing the overall movie-watching experience.

The project consists of several components, including data collection, data processing, model training, and web application development. Movie data can be sourced from public APIs or datasets such as MovieLens. The data is processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy in recommendations.

The web application is built using frameworks like Flask or Django, enabling users to interact with the recommendation system seamlessly. Users can create accounts, rate movies, and receive personalized suggestions based on their ratings.

To run this project, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed, including Flask (or Django), Pandas, NumPy, and any additional libraries needed for data handling and machine learning. The application can be launched locally, allowing users to explore movie recommendations directly from their browsers.

This movie recommendation system showcases the application of machine learning techniques in creating personalized user experiences. It highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in entertainment and aims to help users discover new films they may enjoy.

The project is licensed under the MIT License, and contributions to improve recommendations or enhance the web application are welcome.
